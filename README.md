# WorkTack
## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project was taken from the simplistic functionality for adding and interacting with posted jobs on Craigslist. The idea to have a bulletin board be the main screen for some of the jobs that have been posted comes from our desire to make the job board seem more user friendly. 
### About
A local job board that allows users to capture community jobs. 
The job board allows for users to be able to browse jobs and find jobs that they are interested in. Employers can choose to add jobs by using the "Add Job" button. Jobs that are added will show up in the "More Jobs" page. Clicking on a job listed on the "More Jobs" page shows a detailed description of that job. An edit and delete button on the detailed description page allows for employers to edit the job description or get rid of the job completely.
#### Technologies used
We used JSX and React to create the "About Us" page, the "Add Job" page, the edit job form, the "More Jobs" page and the navbar. We utilized CSS and Bootstrap to style the project. The backend was developed using Node and a schema was setup using JavaScript. The database that we used for this project is MongoDB. 
##### Outstanding Bugs and Unfinished functionality
As of now, we currently do not have any real data that would populate the "More Jobs" page. In the future, we would like to implement real data and have a select few jobs posted on the bulletin board in the home page.
